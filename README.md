## Requirements

### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

###### - Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup)
###### - The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted
###### - The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structure—specifically, a list of dictionaries

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

###### - The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types
###### - The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:
    - How many months exist on Mars?
    - How many Martian days' worth of data are there?
###### - The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer:
    - Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
    - Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
    - How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.
###### - The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file
